#' Divide a grid of cells into partitions containing individual tables
#'
#' @description
#' Given the positions of corner cells that mark individual tables in a single
#' spreadsheet, `partion()` works out which table cells belong to which corner
#' cells.  The individual tables can then be worked on independently.
#'
#' `partition()` partitions along both dimensions (rows and columns) at once.
#' `partition_dim()` partitions along one dimension at a time.
#'
#' @param cells Data frame or tbl, the cells to be partitioned, from
#'   [as_cells()] or [tidyxl::xlsx_cells()].
#' @param corners usually a subset of `cells`, being the corners of individual
#'   tables.  Can also be cells that aren't among `cells`, in which case see the
#'   `strict` argument.
#' @param align Character, the position of the corner cells relative to their
#'   tables, one of `"top-left"` (default), `"top-right"`, `"bottom-left"`,
#'   `"bottom-right"`.
#' @param nest Logical, whether to nest the partitions in a list-column of data
#'   frames.
#' @param strict Logical, whether to omit partitions that don't contain a corner
#'   cell.
#' @param positions Integer vector, the positions of cells (either the row
#'   position or the column position), which are to be grouped between
#'   cutpoints.
#' @param cutpoints Integer vector. The `positions` will be separated into
#'   groups either side of each cutpoint.
#' @param bound One of `"upper"` or `"lower"`, controls whether cells that lie
#'   on a cutpoint are should be grouped with cells below or above the cutpoint.
#'   For example, if column 5 is a cutpoint, and a cell is in column 5,
#'   `"lower"` would group it with cells in columns 1 to 4, whereas `"upper"`
#'   would group it with cells in columns 6 to 10.  This is so that you can use
#'   cells at the bottom or the right-hand side of a table as the cutpoints
#'   (either of which would be 'upper' bounds because row and column numbers
#'   count from 1 in the top-left row and column).  When `"upper"`, any
#'   `cell_positions` above the first cutpoint will be in group 0; when
#'   `"lower"`, any `cell_positions` below the final cutpoint will be 0.
#'
#' @return `partition_dim()` returns an integer vector, numbering the groups of
#'   cells.  Group 0 represents the cells above the first cutpoint (when `bound
#'   = "upper"`), or below the first cutpoint (when `bound = "lower"`).  The
#'   other groups are numbered from 1, where group 1 is adjacent to group 0.
